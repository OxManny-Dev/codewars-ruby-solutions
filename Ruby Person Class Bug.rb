# The following code was thought to be working properly, however when the code tries to access the age of the person instance it fails.

# person = Person.new('Yukihiro', 'Matsumoto', 47)
# puts person.full_name
# puts person.age
# For this exercise you need to fix the code so that it works correctly.


# class Person
#   def initialize(firstName, lastName, age)
#     @firstName = firstName
#     @lastName = lastName
#     @age = age
#   end
  
#   def full_name
#     "#{@firstName} #{@lastName}"
#   end
# end


class Person
  attr_accessor :age
  def initialize(firstName, lastName, age)
    @firstName = firstName
    @lastName = lastName
